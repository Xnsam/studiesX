# Note:

I learn to code from [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/). Huge thanks Navi ( Navdeep Singh !) and [A Common Sense guide to DS and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Common-Sense-Guide-Data-Structures-Algorithms/dp/1680502441). Huge thanks to Jay ( Jay Wengrow !)


Following are a generalized step logic(s) per pattern for quick study
----

*A generalized step logic is the skeleton of how specific pattern works*

<br>

**A. Hash map and sets**
1. Initialize variables and hash map / set
2. Loop over the input 
3. Check on the condition / need for storing

<br>

**B. Two pointers**
1. Initialize pointers ( types of pointer movements: inwards, left follows right)
2. Loop over the input using pointers until a condition *( e.g. l < r )*
3. Check on the condition and update the pointers.

<br>

**C. Sliding Window**
1. Initialize start pointer ( window head ) and data structure
2. Expand the end pointer (window tail ) based on condition / iterator
3. Shrink / Adjust / Slide the window based on a core condition
4. Update results and continue


<br>

**D. Stacks**
Stacks uses LIFO / FILO
1. Initialize stack and variables
2. check stack status 
3. based on a condition pop / push on the stack
4. retrieve the result

<br>

**E. Queue**
Queues uses FIFO
1. Initialize stack variables
2. check queue status
3. based on a condition enqueue / deque from the queue
4. retrieve the result
